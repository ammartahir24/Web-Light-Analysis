Learn Googleâ€™s Web Light Transformations via Deep Learning

## Introduction:
Improving user experience on internet has always been a primary motivation for many improved internet protocols and architectures. Today when there are more than 3.6 billion unique users on internet and a big part of them are from developing nations, it is extremely critical that users from developing countries do not face lags because of limited resources. To address this problem, Google launched Google Web Light which facilitates loading pages faster on slower internet connections by performing multiple transformations and compressions on the html pages. Aim of this project is to perform detailed analysis of transformed pages from Web Light and try to learn using Machine Learning, what optimizations and transformations are being performed. Learning these transformations can help us further in reducing complexities associated with slower connections and low-end devices and improving user experience further.

Repository has been divided into folders that are self-explanatory.
